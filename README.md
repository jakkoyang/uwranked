## 🧠 Concept

- Users are shown **two anonymized LinkedIn profiles** (summary of education & experience).
- They vote on who’s “more cracked.”
- Once voted, both names and ELO scores are revealed.
- The ELO scores are updated based on the outcome.
- A leaderboard showcases the most “cracked” CS majors at UW-Madison.
