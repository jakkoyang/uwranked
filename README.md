# 🔥 Rank UW-Madison CS Majors - Who's More Cracked?

An interactive website inspired by the "Who's More Cracked?" UIUC site, built to **anonymously rank UW-Madison CS majors** based on their LinkedIn experience and education using an **ELO-based** ranking system.

## 🧠 Concept

- Users are shown **two anonymized LinkedIn profiles** (summary of education & experience).
- They vote on who’s “more cracked.”
- Once voted, both names and ELO scores are revealed.
- The ELO scores are updated based on the outcome.
- A leaderboard showcases the most “cracked” CS majors at UW-Madison.
